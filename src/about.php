      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <hr>
      The .dev domain used to belong to no one.  So a lot of companies used the .dev as their development host url when they were building thieir sites locally.<br>
      Then one day Google came along and bought up the entire domain.  So then NO one had access to .dev, and the land was sad.  But then one day, Google<br>
      decided that they would not only let people have .dev again, but this time, it was tied to a legitimate domain that the world could use and see!  So<br>
      since Autus.Com was already taken, I swooped in and jacked moved Autus.Dev at a lightning quick pace, and here I am.  I have no formal training in <br>
      web development or programming, but I grew up around computers and my closest friends have become well established professionals in the computer science<br>
      field. So after years of denying my true nature, here I am, way older and more set in my ways, trying to learn web development from the ground up.<br>
      Welcome to Autus.Dev.
