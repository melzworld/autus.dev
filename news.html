      <h3>Things I did today</h3>
        <p>I created the PNG logo and added it to the site. I also created a bunch of .html files to build the navigation.<br>
          With help I was able to get the Zohomail connected to the autus.dev domain.  I was also able to create a droplet<br>
          on Digital Ocean.  My plan was to get this basic page onto there, but then I screwed myself over because I used <br>
          a domain e-mail for my verification e-mail which also meant I activated the E-mail 2-Factor for it as well. Basically<br>
          I screwed myself over.  I just read that I wrote "screwed myself over" twice.  Three times. Lyrics of fury.</p>

          <h3>Layoffs and Source Control</h3>
            <p>Today's lesson is: You don't have to CLONE every branch of a Repository.  You know how there's no such thing<br>
              as a stupid question?  There is stupid answers.  And my answer for how to handle a Master/Dev/Dev2019 branch<br>
            was to clone it several times.  Yeah.  You only need to clone it once.  Also, how did I fix my Digital Ocean problem?<br>
          Basically I was still logged into it at work, so I hopped into the account, and updated the e-mail address.  But <br>
        unfortunately, I had little to no time to work on it because today my company laid off like 15% of the office.  Or<br>
      8 people. So I was so busy with mini meetings and "oh shit are we next" chatter that i didn't even get to update my<br>
    feed.  Anyway, my lesson was "I still need to learn a lot about Git".</p>

              <h3>AM I STARTING TO GET GIT?</h3>
                <p>As I was driving to work, I suddenly came to the conclusion I didn't need to ever LEAVE the public folder.<br>
                I simply just had to BRANCH from my master, and I'd STILL be in the same folder.  There was this mental block<br>
                to understanding GIT, and I'm thinking that today, something clicked.  So I branched, and I pulled, and low and<br>
                behold I was able to seamlessly update the site with the merge in the Development Branch.  That being said<br>
                Anthony thinks pulling directly into serving a website is a horrific idea. Oh well.</p>
