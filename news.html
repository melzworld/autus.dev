      <h3>Things I did today</h3>
        <p>I created the PNG logo and added it to the site. I also created a bunch of .html files to build the navigation.<br>
          With help I was able to get the Zohomail connected to the autus.dev domain.  I was also able to create a droplet<br>
          on Digital Ocean.  My plan was to get this basic page onto there, but then I screwed myself over because I used <br>
          a domain e-mail for my verification e-mail which also meant I activated the E-mail 2-Factor for it as well. Basically<br>
          I screwed myself over.  I just read that I wrote "screwed myself over" twice.  Three times. Lyrics of fury.</p>
